 - final last create RD-RA.ipynb reads RD and RA map videos, and converts them to numpy arrays, and saves them to a local memory.
 - final last create spect env.ipynb reads micro-Doppler spectrogram images and envelopes, and converts them to numpy arrays, and saves them to a local memory.
 - Final baseline 2.ipynb loads saved numpy files, and trains/tests the models presented in the paper.
 - Final Trigger.ipynb imports the trained models and apply cumulative score aggregating (CSA) based trigger detection for each sign.
