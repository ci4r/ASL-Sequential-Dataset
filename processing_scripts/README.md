E. KurtoÄŸlu, A. C. Gurbuz, E. A. Malaia, D. Griffin, C. Crawford and S. Z. Gurbuz, `"ASL Trigger Recognition in Mixed Activity/Signing Sequences for RF Sensor-Based User Interfaces,"` in IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems, vol. 52, no. 4, pp. 699-712, Aug. 2022, doi: 10.1109/THMS.2021.3131675.

The dataset consists of 15 ASL signs and 3 human daily activities and it is available in [here](https://github.com/ci4r/ASL-Sequential-Dataset).  

While MATLAB scripts are used for raw data processing to generate `range-Doppler`, `range-Azimuth` maps and `micro-Doppler` spectrograms, Python scripts are used for classification.

`Python/create_dataset*.ipynb` files are used to read the created videos and images and save them as pickle or .hdf5 files.

`Python/Final baseline 2.ipynb` is the main classification script which implements the STA/LTA motion detector and the JD-MTML model explained in the paper.
